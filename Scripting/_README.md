About
-----
This folder contains a few sample AppleScripts for working with _Balthisar Tidy_.
They’re not intended for real-world production use, but they do demonstrate how
to use _Balthisar Tidy_’s AppleScript options.

Some of the scripts are available in different formats:

- .app to make it work directly from Finder.
- .scpt to make it load into your script editor first, from where it can be run.


`_Sample xxx (original).html` and `Sample xxx.html`
----------------------------------------------------

Some of the scripts expect to find certain sample HTML documents in the same
folder location as the script, so it's a good idea to leave these files alone.

The `_Sample xxx (original).html` aren’t used by any of the scripts, but
I leave them in this directory in case I accidentally overwrite the sample
documents.


The Scripts
-----------

The scripts are fairly well documented.


The _Disk Image Project
-----------------------

These scripts are distributed on a disk image within the
_Balthisar Tidy for Work_ application package, and have their own readme’s.

They’re fairly production-ready in the sense of being technology demonstrations.
